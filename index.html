        For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools
        available for creating CSS layouts were things like
        <code>floats</code> and <code>positioning</code>. These are fine and
        they work, but in some ways they are also rather limiting and
        frustrating. The following simple layout requirements are either
        difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools, in any kind of
        convenient, flexible way: Vertically centering a block of content inside
        its parent. Making all the children of a container take up an equal
        amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much
        width/height is available. Making all columns in a multiple column
        layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of
        content. As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of
        layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!
